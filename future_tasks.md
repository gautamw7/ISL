Biased Model: The model may perform better on words with more videos and worse on words with fewer videos because it has more examples to learn from for certain words.
Poor Generalization: Words with fewer videos might not be learned effectively, leading to lower accuracy for those words.
To address this, you need to balance the dataset. Balancing can be done by either:

Increasing the number of examples for underrepresented words (e.g., words with fewer videos).
Reducing the number of examples for overrepresented words (e.g., words with more videos, though this is less common in your case since the max is 22).
